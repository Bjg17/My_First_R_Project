# R MARKDOWN

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## INSTALLING & LOADING PACKAGES AND DATA



```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(rattle)
```

Loading the data and checking its content and types.

```{r bikes}
bikes_data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\bikes_1.csv")
head(bikes_data)
summary(bikes_data)
```

Counting the amount of rows/records in the original dataset.

```{r}
count(bikes_data)
```

Counting the unique values.

```{r}
count(bikes_data %>% distinct())
```

## CLEANING THE DATA

Creating a new column with the help of the case_when function.

```{r}
bikes_data <- bikes_data %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(Age_Category = case_when(
    Age <= 35 ~ "Young",
    Age >35 & Age <= 50 ~ "Middle Age",
    Age > 50 ~ "Old"))
```

Dropping the age column

```{r}
bikes_data <- bikes_data %>%
  select(!Age)
```

Updating columns.

```{r}
bikes_data <- bikes_data%>%
  mutate(Commute.Distance = replace( Commute.Distance,Commute.Distance == "10+ Miles","More than 10 Miles"))%>%
  mutate(Marital_Status = replace(Marital_Status, Marital_Status == "S", "Single"))%>%
  mutate(Marital_Status = replace(Marital_Status, Marital_Status == "M", "Married"))%>%
  mutate(Gender = replace(Gender, Gender == "M", "Male"))%>%
  mutate(Gender = replace(Gender, Gender == "F", "Female"))
```

```{r}
bikes_data
```

## VISUALISING THE DATA

Using ggplot, to create a bar chart to discover who is more inclined to buy bikes: single or married.

```{r}
marital_status <- bikes_data%>%
  select(Marital_Status, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Marital_Status, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop")
marital_status

ggplot(marital_status, aes(x = Marital_Status, y = n, label = n, fill = Purchased_Bike))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(.7), width = .5)+
  #geom_text()+
  geom_label(position = position_dodge2(width = .7))+
  labs(title = "Married vs Single", 
       subtitle = "This chart shows who is more inclined to buy and not buy a  bike",
       y = "Count")
```

Using ggplot, to create a bar chart to discover who is more inclined to buy bikes: men or women.

```{r}
genders <- bikes_data%>% 
  select(Gender, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Gender, Purchased_Bike)%>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop")

genders

ggplot(genders, aes(x = Gender, y = n, label = n, fill = Purchased_Bike))+ 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(.7), width = .5)+ 
  geom_label(position = position_dodge2(width = .7))+ 
  labs(title = "Males vs Females", subtitle = "This chart shows who is more inclined to buy and not buyi  bike", y = "Count")
```

Using ggplot, to create a bar chart to discover who is more inclined to buy bikes: men(between Single and Married) or women(Single and Married).

```{r}
gender_maritalStatus <- bikes_data%>%
  select(Gender, Marital_Status, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Gender, Marital_Status, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(gender_maritalStatus, aes(x = Marital_Status, y = count, fill = Purchased_Bike, label = count))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = .7), width = .5)+
  geom_label(position = position_dodge(width = .7))+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)+
  labs(title = "Males vs Females", caption = "2 facets females and Males, inside of each facet it shows single and married people", x = "" ,y = "Count")
```

Using ggplot, create a bar chart to show the total number of participants, in each occupation category.

```{r}
total_participants_Categories <- bikes_data%>%
  select(Occupation)%>%
  group_by(Occupation)%>%
  summarise(total = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(total_participants_Categories, aes(x = Occupation, y = total, label = total, fill = Occupation))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  geom_label()+
  labs(title = "Categories", subtitle = "Total number of customers in each category", y = "Count")
```

Using ggplot, create a bar chart to discover the occupations with more than 10 miles of commute distance, as this suggest people with more than 10 miles of distance are less willing to buy a bike.

```{r}
profession <- bikes_data %>%
  group_by(Occupation, Commute.Distance, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop")%>%
  filter(Commute.Distance == "More than 10 Miles")

ggplot(profession, aes(x = Occupation, y = n, label = n, fill = Purchased_Bike))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  geom_text()+
  labs(title = "Occupations with more than 10 miles", y = "Count")+
  geom_label()
```

Using ggplot, create a line chart to discover purchases, based on commute distance.

```{r}
bikes_data%>%
  select(Commute.Distance, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Commute.Distance, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Commute.Distance, y = count, color = Purchased_Bike, label = count ))+
  geom_line(linetype = "solid", color = "black")+
  geom_label()+
  labs(title = "Line Graph Showing Purchases Based on Commute Distance")
```

The outcome of this chart demonstrates only 0.07% of users with a commute distance of more than 10 miles, decided to buy a bike. The chart above,line 162 shows only 33 people bought a bike. The chart below indicates that 485 bikes have been bought. 33 / 485 = 0.068%

```{r}
profession_buying_bikes <- bikes_data%>%
  select(Occupation, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Occupation, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(profession_buying_bikes, aes(x = Occupation, y = count, fill = Purchased_Bike, label = count))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(0.5), width = 0.3)+
 ## geom_text_repel(color = "#FFFFFF")+
  geom_label(position = position_dodge(0.5))+
  labs(title = "Profession", y = "Count")
```

using ggplot, to find trends about the education and purchases.

```{r}
education_buying_bikes <- bikes_data%>%
  select(Education, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Education, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(education_buying_bikes, aes(x = Education, y = count, fill = Purchased_Bike, label = count))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(0.5), width = 0.3)+
  geom_label(position = position_dodge(0.5))+
  labs(title = "Education", y = "Count")
```

using ggplot, to find trends about the region and purchases.

```{r}
region_buying_bikes <- bikes_data%>%
  select(Region, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Region, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(region_buying_bikes, aes(x = Region, y = count, fill = Purchased_Bike, label = count))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(0.5), width = 0.3)+
  geom_label(position = position_dodge(0.5))+
  labs(title = "Region", y = "Count")
```

using ggplot, to find trends about the Age Categories and purchases.

```{r}
agesVSbuying <-  bikes_data%>%
  select(Age_Category, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  group_by(Age_Category, Purchased_Bike)%>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(agesVSbuying, aes(x = Age_Category, y = count, fill = Purchased_Bike, label = count))+
  geom_point(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(0.5))+
  ## geom_text_repel(color = "#FFFFFF")+
  #geom_label(position = position_dodge(0.5))
  geom_label()+
  labs(title = "Age Categories", y = "Count")
```

## CREATING A DECISON TREEMODEL

Creating a sample

```{r}
set.seed(1)

sample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(bikes_data), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
train <- bikes_data[sample, ]
test <- bikes_data[!sample, ]
```

Creating the decision tree

```{r}
bikes_tree <- rpart(formula = Purchased_Bike ~ Gender + Marital_Status + Income + Children + 
                      Home_Owner + Cars + Education + Occupation + Commute.Distance +
                      Region + Age_Category,
                    cp = 0.01,
                    maxdepth = 5,
                    data = train, 
                    method = "class")
```

Using the cp functions

```{r}
plotcp(bikes_tree)
printcp(bikes_tree)
```

Checking misclassification error.

```{r}
sum(predict(bikes_tree, type = "class")!=train$Purchased_Bike) / nrow(train)
```

Visualize decision tree

```{r}
fancyRpartPlot(bikes_tree)
```

predicting and binding the column to the bikes_tree dataset.

```{r}
predicted_purchase <- predict(bikes_tree, type = "class")
bind_tables <- cbind(train, predicted_purchase)
```

```{r}
bind_tables
```

the model with new data

```{r}
new_input <- predict(object = bikes_tree, 
                     newdata = data.frame(
                       Gender = "Male", Marital_Status = "Married", Income = "$30,000.00", Children = 2,
                       Home_Owner = "No", Cars = 1, Education = "Bachelors", 
                       Occupation = "Professional", Commute.Distance = "0-1 Miles",
                       Region = "North America", Age_Category = "Middle Age"),
                     type = "class")
```

```{r}
new_input
```
